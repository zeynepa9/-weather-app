# Weather Me - Weather Forecast Application

Welcome to the Weather Me application! This project uses the WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data based on user input. Users can search for any location and choose to display the weather information in Celsius.

## Deployment

Visit the deployed TODO List app at [https://zeynepa9.github.io/weather-app/](https://zeynepa9.github.io/weather-app/) to see the project live.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to consolidate knowledge of API usage, asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamically updating the DOM. This application allows users to search for a specific location and see the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and a brief description like 'Clear', 'Rain', etc. The page's appearance changes according to the weather data, providing an engaging user experience.

## Features

- Search for a specific location's weather data.
- Integration with the Giphy API to display weather-related GIFs.
- Use of async/await for asynchronous operations.


## API Keys and Security

The WeatherAPI & GIPHY keys are used in this project is placed in the frontend code for simplicity and learning purposes. 


## Lessons Learned

- **API Interaction:** Learned how to effectively make requests to an external API and handle responses. Gained insight into dealing with JSON data and dynamically updating the DOM based on that data.

- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Became more comfortable with asynchronous code in JavaScript using both promises and async/await patterns. This was crucial for handling API responses that are not immediately available.

- **Error Handling:** Improved error handling in asynchronous operations to provide feedback to the user and for debugging purposes.




This project is for educational purposes and is part of the JavaScript curriculum at The Odin Project.
